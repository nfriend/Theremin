Theremin
========

A musical instrument using Chrome, the HTML5 Web Audio API, and a Leap Motion controller.  Try it for yourself [here](http://nathanfriend.com/theremin/ "Nathan Friend: Theremin")!

Instructions
------------
Theremin uses the Leap Motion controller to provide a hand-free way to make music, much like the original [theremin](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin "Wikipedia: theremin").  The first hand detected by the Leap Motion controls pitch (y-axis), volume (z-axis), and tone (wrist rotation).  The second hand detected is assigned the responsibility of controlling vibrato, specifically its speed (z-axis) and amplitude (y-axis).
